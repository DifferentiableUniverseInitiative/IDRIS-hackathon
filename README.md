# 2021 IDRIS GPU hackathon
Repository for hosting material and discussions for the 2021 IDRIS GPU hackathon

In this hackathon we will be working on 3 layers:
  - [Horovod Fork](https://github.com/DifferentiableUniverseInitiative/horovod/tree/multiple_communicators): Interface to NCCL comms from TensorFlow
  - [Mesh TensorFlow Fork](https://github.com/DifferentiableUniverseInitiative/mesh/tree/hvd): SPMD Mesh implementation based on Horovod
  - [FlowPM](https://github.com/DifferentiableUniverseInitiative/flowpm.git): Distributed PM solver
  based on Mesh TensorFlow


To get started with the hackathon checkout [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)
